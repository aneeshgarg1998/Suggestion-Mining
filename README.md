# Task: Suggestion Mining

-> Suggestion mining can be defined as the extraction of suggestions from unstructured text, where the term 'suggestions' refers to the expressions of tips, advice, recommendations etc. Consumer opinions towards commercial entities like brands, services, and products are generally expressed through online reviews, blogs, discussion forums, or social media platforms. These opinions largely express positive and negative sentiments towards a given entity, but also tend to contain suggestions for improvising the entity or tips to the fellow consumers. We had to perform domain specific suggestion mining, where the test dataset belonged to the same domain as the training and development datasets.
